# last-successful-build-action

This action searches for the last successful workflow-run for the given workflow-name and branch. 
The `sha` of the workflow-commit is set as output-parameter. If no matching workflow exists, the `sha` of the current run is emitted.

## Usage

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Find matching workflow
        uses: shantanus1/last-successful-build-action@v2
        with:
          token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          branch: "development"
          workflow: "build"
```

## Verifying workflow run SHAs
If your workflow runs are expected to contain no-longer existing commit SHAs (e.g. when squashing and force pushing) you need to verify the SHA of the workflow run commit against the list of commit SHAs in your repository.

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # check out the entire repo history for SHA verification
      - name: Find matching workflow
        uses: shantanus1/last-successful-build-action@v2
        with:
          branch: "development"
          workflow: "build"
          verify: true
```
